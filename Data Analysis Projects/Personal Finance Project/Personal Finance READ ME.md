# Personal Finance
In other to improve my relationship with money, I decided to make a finance tracker to help with that.
For most this project I use [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vEobyPacJvvCKcYRdku-EP6aoEGuqFK67RVonRGobpY/edit?usp=sharing). However, I use [Google Form](https://forms.gle/rfmUZF7yRDtMbejJA). for data collection and [Apps Script](https://github.com/Hemephelus/Data-Analyst/blob/ebd313ba68055096e133469ec488202a3d95cd4b/Data%20Analysis%20Projects/Personal%20Finance%20Project/Automation%20Code). for Automation.

## The Tabs
*Google Sheets*

In the sheet we have 6 Tabs.

 ### 1. Summary
  - This tab represents the dashboard as it shows a live and dynamic interface that allows you to see a summary of my finances at any point in time. 
  - You can change the time frame to see how much was spent during a particular period.
  - There are 2 charts on the tab.  The 1st is a bar graph that shows the average amount of money spent in a particular category. Secondly, we have the another bar graph that shows the average amount spent in a particular item (a subset of a category).
  - The cells with a gray background shows the places you can edit.

  ### 2. Expenses
  
  ### 3. Income
  ### 4. Details
